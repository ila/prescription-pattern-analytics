\section{Healthcare analytics}
\textbf{Healthcare analytics} is a field of growing importance which allows a deep understanding of results collected in the healthcare area. 

Extracting insights can be a complex challenge: health big data gives a huge \textit{volume} and \textit{variety} of information, therefore accessing the resources in a quick way is necessary. 

Other issues to deal with are \textit{veracity}, \textit{validity} and \textit{viability}, fundamental characteristics to ensure reliable and relevant analytics. Checking for integrity and quality can be difficult to verify without domain knowledge\cite{4vs}.

One of the various applications of this field is the change of patterns in the historical data: this research specifically focuses on \textbf{prescription pattern changes} on chronic patients, highlighting the development of some common medicines through time.

The considered healthcare data is a dump of a database created and handled by Millennium Srl\cite{millewin}, a leader company in IT services for medicine. This has been obtained through an extraction procedure on the original DB, assigning unique names to each table and column.

There are five main necessary fields for analysis\cite{DC}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Spatial data}, in different granularity levels;
	\item \textbf{Personal data} of patients;
	\item \textbf{Temporal data}, in a range from 2000 to 2018, for time-series analysis;
	\item \textbf{Pharmacotherapeutic data}, classifiable according to different identification codes;
	\item \textbf{Diagnostic data}, for cross-validation of diagnoses.
\end{enumerate}

The two main risks encountered while doing analysis are information loss and inappropriate prescribing, that compromise the quality of the statistics. Data may be incomplete, biased or filled with noise: another goal of analytics is to contrast incompleteness and incorrectness, obtaining coherent and clear results.
